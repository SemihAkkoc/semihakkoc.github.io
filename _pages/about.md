I am an undergraduate researcher at Bilkent University working at the intersection of semantic signal processing, communications, and computational electromagnetics.

My current research includes practical hardware demonstrations of goal-oriented semantic communication systems using Raspberry Pi platforms, as well as electromagnetic simulation studies based on the method of moments.

I previously completed internships at Huawei, Aselsan, and BITES, where I worked on semantic communication prototypes, dielectric material characterization workflows, and networked software systems. I am especially interested in efficient next-generation communication and sensing systems combining signal processing, machine learning, and hardware-aware design.
