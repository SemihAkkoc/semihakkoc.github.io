I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I am advised by <a href="https://user.eng.umd.edu/~ulukus/">Prof. Sennur Ulukus</a>. My research generally lies at the intersection of information theory, machine learning, and signal processing.

My current academic interests focus on the theoretical foundations of modern AI architectures, specifically exploring tokenization in Large Language Models (LLMs) and optimization techniques for Transformers. I am also deeply interested in advanced topics within statistical signal processing and detection theory. Alongside my research, I serve as a Teaching Assistant within the ECE department at UMD.

Before coming to Maryland, I completed my undergraduate studies at Bilkent University, where I double-majored in Electrical Engineering and Physics. My earlier background includes practical hardware demonstrations, electromagnetic simulation studies, and industry internships at Huawei, Aselsan, and BITES, where I worked on semantic communication prototypes and networked software systems.
